    Games::Word::Wordlist::Country - English names of countries of the world

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Games::Word::Wordlist::Country
    (from Perl distribution Games-Word-Wordlist-Country), released on
    2014-10-07.

SYNOPSIS
      use Games::Word::Wordlist::Country;
      my $wl = Games::Word::Wordlist::Country->new;
      my $word = $wl->random_word;
      print "We have a word." if $wl->is_word ($word);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides English names of countries of the world. You can
    use this in some word games, e.g. Games::Word::Hangman.

    The list is produced using the latest Locale::Codes during build time,
    using the shortest name for each country, then converted to lowercase.
    Some words will contain whitespace (e.g. "Sri Lanka") or parentheses
    (e.g. "Virgin Islands (UK)"). If you only want single words, you can use
    Games::Word::Wordlist::CountrySingleWord.
